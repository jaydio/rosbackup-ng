# Tmpfs Features

RouterOS Backup NG can be configured to use tmpfs (a temporary file system) to minimize flash storage wear when creating backups. This feature is available on RouterOS devices running v7.7 or later. If tmpfs is enabled in the global or target-specific settings, the tool automatically checks the RouterOS version and falls back to root storage if the version is earlier than v7.7. [RouterOS v7.7 changelog showing added support for tmpfs][1].

## Overview

When creating binary backups, the tool can use RouterOS's built-in tmpfs support to store the backup file temporarily in RAM instead of writing it directly to the router's flash storage. This helps preserve the lifespan of the router's storage by reducing write cycles.

## How It Works

1. Before creating a backup, the tool:
   - Checks if tmpfs is enabled (default: true)
   - Calculates appropriate tmpfs size based on available memory
   - Creates a tmpfs mount at `/rosbackup/`

2. During backup:
   - The backup file is created in the tmpfs mount
   - The file is downloaded to the backup server
   - The tmpfs is automatically cleaned up

3. If `keep_binary_backup` is true:
   - The backup is moved from tmpfs to root storage
   - The move operation is verified
   - The tmpfs is then cleaned up

## Memory-Based Size Calculation

The tool automatically calculates the appropriate tmpfs size based on the router's available memory:

- For routers with â‰¥256MB free memory:
  - Uses a fixed size of 50MB

- For routers with <256MB free memory:
  - Uses 1% of the available memory
  - Minimum size is 1MB

## Configuration

### Global Configuration (global.yaml)

```yaml
# Temporary Storage Settings
tmpfs:
  enabled: true              # Use tmpfs for temporary storage (default: true)
  fallback_enabled: true     # Fall back to root storage if tmpfs fails (default: true)
  size_auto: true           # Calculate size based on available memory (default: true)
  size_mb: 50               # Fixed size in MB when size_auto is false (default: 50)
  min_size_mb: 1            # Minimum size in MB for auto calculation (default: 1)
  max_size_mb: 50           # Maximum size in MB for auto calculation (default: 50)
  mount_point: "rosbackup"  # Mount point name for tmpfs (default: "rosbackup")
```

### Target-Specific Configuration (targets.yaml)

```yaml
targets:
  - name: ROUTER-1
    # ... other settings ...
    tmpfs:
      enabled: true          # Override global tmpfs enable/disable (optional)
      fallback_enabled: true # Override global fallback behavior (optional)
      size_mb: 25           # Override global fixed size in MB (optional)
```

Note: Target-specific configuration only supports overriding `enabled`, `fallback_enabled`, and `size_mb`. Other parameters like `size_auto`, `min_size_mb`, `max_size_mb`, and `mount_point` can only be set globally.

### Command Line Options

- `--no-tmpfs` or `-T`: Disable tmpfs usage for all targets
- `--tmpfs-size` or `-s`: Override tmpfs size for all targets (e.g., "25M")

## Fallback Behavior

If tmpfs creation fails:

1. With `tmpfs_fallback: true` (default):
   - Falls back to using root storage
   - Logs a warning message
   - Continues with backup

2. With `tmpfs_fallback: false`:
   - Logs an error message
   - Aborts the backup operation

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Consideration**:
   - Leave sufficient free memory for router operations
   - Monitor memory usage if customizing tmpfs size

2. **Size Configuration**:
   - Use auto-calculation when possible
   - If setting manual size, ensure it's sufficient for your backups
   - Consider router's total memory when setting size

3. **Fallback Settings**:
   - Keep fallback enabled unless you have specific requirements
   - Monitor backup logs for fallback occurrences

4. **Target-Specific Settings**:
   - Override global settings only when necessary
   - Document reasons for target-specific configurations

## Troubleshooting

1. **Tmpfs Creation Fails**:
   - Check available memory
   - Verify tmpfs size is appropriate
   - Check RouterOS version (requires v7+)

2. **Backup Fails with Tmpfs**:
   - Check system logs for errors
   - Verify tmpfs mount point exists
   - Try reducing tmpfs size

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Monitor memory usage during backups
   - Adjust tmpfs size if needed
   - Consider disabling tmpfs for affected targets

## Technical Details

The tmpfs implementation uses RouterOS's built-in disk management:

```
# Create tmpfs
/disk/add type=tmpfs tmpfs-max-size=50M slot=rosbackup

# Remove tmpfs
/disk/remove [find slot=rosbackup]
```

The tmpfs is automatically mounted at `/rosbackup/` and is used exclusively for temporary backup storage.
